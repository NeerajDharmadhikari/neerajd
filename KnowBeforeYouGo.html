                    According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, as of December 2020, there are 
                    15 million cases of COVID-19 and around 285 thousand COVID-19 related deaths in the United States. 
                    Subsequently, COVID-19 restrictions recommend people to stay indoors to help stop the spread of the 
                    virus; however, this poses new challenges for everyday tasks, such as buying food, groceries, 
                    medicine, and other essential items. There might be other reasons why people might choose to step 
                    outside their homes; however, they may not be equipped with the proper knowledge of the pandemic 
                    restrictions for the locations they want to visit.

                    We decided to learn about what information people want to know before going outside 
                    during the pandemic and then created an application prototype tailored to those needs that can 
                    help people know all the information they want before they go somewhere. Introducing <strong>Know Before You Go</strong>...

            <h2>Human-Centered Design</h2>
            <p>
                Our approach to designing the prototype implemented <strong>Human-Centered Design (HCD)</strong>, a process working 
                around the understanding of peoples’ wants and needs with constant involvement from many testers, survey 
                participants, and our design team.<br><br> We started by designing a <strong>survey</strong> to assess the needs of our 
                target audience, which are smartphone users aged 18-50 that want or need to go out but are 
                concerned about the pandemic. <br><br>After learning about their experiences and perspectives, we 
                created <strong>workflow diagrams and scenarios</strong> that these people might encounter, focusing on how they will 
                access the information they need quickly. We converted our diagrams into 
                <strong>paper mockups</strong> and used <strong>rapid low-fidelity prototyping</strong> to evolve our design. <br><br>With our peers’ feedback, we 
                iterated on our design using Marvel and Figma to create interactive prototypes. Finally, we performed 
                <strong>usability testing</strong> with a few people using the <strong>think-aloud protocol</strong> and observation via remote calling. 
                We took our observations from the testing sessions to iteratively improve our design.

          <h2>Formative Stage</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.2rem;">In our formative stage, we used a Google Form survey that took around 5 to 10 minutes to complete. 
              It consisted of four main sections: <br><br><strong>Demographic-based information:</strong> This is 
              where we asked the participants for their name, age, and current location.
              <br><strong>Experiences During the Pandemic:</strong> This is where we asked the participants about their comfort 
              levels and factors in visiting locations they go to during the pandemic. We asked how important it is for them 
              that certain restrictions exist and whether they would make decisions based on specific factors or information. 
              <br><strong>Situational Questions:</strong> This is where we provided the participants with scenarios and asked what they would do if they experienced a similar scenario. This is also where we asked them directly whether they would benefit from an application that provided information to prevent them from being in scenarios they do not want to be in.
              <br><strong>Raffle Information:</strong> This is where the participants opted in to the $10 Starbucks gift card raffle that we ran at the conclusion of the open survey period.</p>

        <p><strong>We reached out to our contacts and received 48 responses with ages ranging from 18-29 and mostly living in California. From these responses, we observed the following:</strong></p>

              I went to Albertson's and that plaza surprisingly had a lot of people dining outside and not wearing any masks.

              Went to the park for a walk and there were people without masks. Most people were not social distancing. I ended up

              I socially distanced at least 6 feet, if not, more. I also did my best to have hand sanitizer on me whenever

              Costco!!! It might be all the deals, but it's crazy how people forget about social distancing rules +

              I go on trails often, if I see someone coming towards me without a face mask I distance myself as

              I didn’t see anyone on the trail, sometimes I would take off my face mask temporarily but still wear it around my chin, so if I saw someone coming I would put it on right away.

        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">
            <strong>COVID-19 Related Policies:</strong>  Based on the qualitative responses to our survey’s scenario questions, we 
            learned how uncomfortable our participants are around people that do not wear facemasks, sometimes 
            leading our participants to react involuntarily (ie. having a panic attack). We also learned that 
            participants wanted to know “what restaurants are not allowing outdoor seating,” and “how often the 
            location [is] sanitized.” We gathered information like this to design a component that shows them 
            whether locations enforce these restrictions and have features that help them feel safe. 
            <br><br><strong>Crowd Density: </strong>
            Many participants claimed to “leave [a location] if there are too many people” or 
            stay away when they see crowded areas during the pandemic. They also want to know about the maximum 
            capacity of various locations. This led us to design a component for crowd density, a measure of how 
            many people are congregating in one location, to show our potential users how crowded a location is.
            <br><br><strong>Hours: </strong>Many participants also found themselves unaware of various locations’ operating hours changing 
            due to the pandemic. One participant “couldn’t tell just from Google or Yelp whether it was open 
            because they each conflicted with each other.” Another participant put it best: it is “more important 
            to prove that [a given time] is for sure the hours of the business.” Thus, we decided to design a 
            component that shows the updated hours of locations and show an indicator listing when the hours were 
            last updated. This will give the user confidence that the hours are indeed up-to-date.

                <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; text-align: left;">
                    <strong>Based on what we learned above, we designed two tasks we believe recognize the needs of our participants:</strong>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.1rem;">
                    <strong>1.</strong> You don't know the updated COVID-19 policies between two locations. Look up their COVID-19 
                    policies and make a decision on which location you would go to.<br>
                    <strong>2.</strong> Explore nearby cafes in your area that offer outdoor seating. Which locations did you find? 
                    Which location would you go to based on their location details?
                </p>
            </div>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">We created a diagram to map out our application’s workflow. We started by drawing <strong>a workflow diagram</strong> 
                where the items are our proposed screens and the arrows are the transitions between the screens. 
                In each screen, we wrote notes on what features should go in them, and prioritized them by 
                importance. </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The screen with the location’s details on COVID-19 policies is the most important screen; 
                so we worked on that screen first. We iterated on the screen’s design through <strong>rapid prototyping</strong>, 
                first drawing our separate visions of the screens in 5 minutes then meeting together to discuss their important features. 
                Eventually, we merged the concepts that we liked into a singular sketch for that screen for a total of five

                Next, we took photos of our sketched screens and uploaded them to the <a href="https://marvelapp.com/" target="_blank">Marvel
                     prototyping tool</a>. This allowed us to add basic interactivity to our UI elements that, when clicked on, 
                     enabled users to traverse the flow structure that we designed. We had two people in our design focus group 
                     test this prototype by asking them to complete our two tasks. From this review, we learned that it was 
                     difficult for them to figure out which features were buttons or labels. This made it difficult to discover 
                     the functionality of our prototype. <br> </p>

                     <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><strong>Transition to Figma</strong><br>
                    After discussing these reviews, we modified our sketches and reconstructed them on Figma for 
                    higher-fidelity-prototype. With Figma, we can add phone design elements to better show buttons, 
                    labels, scroll-bars, and more. We made sure that buttons were distinct from other UI elements by 
                    enlarging the buttons, adding a gradient effect inside them, and curving the edges. We also 
                    organized our content in symmetric, concise subsections, paying attention to colors and fonts. 
                    The result is a higher-fidelity prototype that we can give to our testers for evaluation.

            <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><strong>Methods</strong><br>
                We divided our evaluation component into two rounds of two people each using a mix of Zoom and 
                in-person interviews. We recorded the participants’ screens and observed their behavior by tracking
                 their pointer movements and encouraging them to <strong>think aloud</strong> as they completed their tasks. 
                 After completing each task, we asked them which location they would go to and why. We ended by 
                 asking follow-up questions to our participants about their choices that differed from our 
                 expectations.

                <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><strong>Population Sample</strong><br>
                    Our population sample consists of users that did not participate in our survey, have tasks that
                     require them to go outside in some way, and are smartphone users. Our participants are aged 
                     23-47 and currently use iPhones. We interviewed 4 people total across two rounds of testing.
                      We also made sure that they had access to a computer with a web browser and were willing to 
                      be recorded for our evaluation. 
                <br> </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><strong>Methods</strong><br>
                        In our rounds of evaluation, we gained knowledge on feature discovery, button placement, 
                        and making clear the overall functionality and purpose of our application. Some of our 
                        labels were confusing to our testers, drawing their attention away from our application’s 
                        functionality. We also realized that some of our navigational features were inconsistent 
                        with some screens lacking buttons to undo actions. Nevertheless, we were glad that our 
                        participants were able to make decisions on which location to go to (or not go to) 
                        and finish the tasks that we provided.

                There's a filter (button) and also filters (tab). So maybe the button should say "Apply" instead, because I got confused.

                (Blaze Pizza) looks like a pretty good option. They don't have outdoor seating but if I want to come home 
                and eat then it's a pretty good option. Eureka, on the other hand, has outdoor seating but it's a lot more crowded
                and 40% capacity...yellow/orange compared to green...so I'm tempted to say Blaze Pizza is safer, because I can just pick
                up and eat at the park or something.

                If I knew I was in the mood for coffee, but I didn't know a specific spot, (and) I did want to make sure that they follow
                specific policies, then I probably (would) use the map for that and filter these out.

                  I was actually quite amaze that the information could be potentially available. It's really easy 
                  to understand the graph... people tend to want to go to less crowded areas. So I see that's a

                  I really like [the crowd density] feature. For me, I would be hesitant to go to that place 
                  because I want to make sure that... less crowded fits my preferences for social distancing and 
                  all that, just to make sure that other people are safe and I'm safe.
