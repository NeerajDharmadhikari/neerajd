				<h1>About Me:</h1>
				<p>
					My name is Neeraj Dharmadhikari and I'm a 20 year old photographer from San Francisco Bay Area. I'm currently a third year at University of California, Irvine, majoring in Computer Science. I found a passion for Photography three years ago after I started to adventure outside the bubble of my hometown and realized there were so many beautiful sights worth remembering. I also wanted to photograph my personal highlight moments with friends and family during our adventures. After taking two courses in Photography and buying my own camera with a prime lens, I started uncovering the secrets to my Nikon D3300. I've compiled a portfolio of my best photos and I hope you see the journey I've been on over the last three years. 
					As I explore the world further, I'll continue to update my portfolio and post my favorite moments. If you want to check out more of my work, check out my flickr photostream.
					Feel free to contact me for a shoot and follow me on instragram: neerajd24
