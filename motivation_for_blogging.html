        <p>
            I grew up for the most part of my life in a privileged bubble of Cupertino, California. My parents sacrificed a lot to make sure 
            that my sister and I grew up in a safe community with good schools and with ample opportunities to succeed. I was usually a shy kid 
            up until high school who never spoke out his beliefs in fear of being shut down by the consensus. I realized I wasn't afraid to stand up
            but terrified of standing alone. I wanted to act and talk bold as the opinionated teenager in me realized the injustices around me, but for
            the longest time I was scared I wouldn't be able to get my thoughts across properly. As soneone whose first language wasn't English, I never
            used to consider myself as the "one with the right words." I was always afraid of not saying the right thing in a group or saying the right thing
            but being misunderstood. I let that fear control me for a long time, up until high school. I'm done letting it consume me now.
